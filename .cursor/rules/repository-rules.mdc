# Repository structure

- This repository lives at `https://github.com/pulsemcp/mcp-servers` (owner: `pulsemcp`, repo: `mcp-servers`).
- It is a monorepo, where each subfolder represents a standalone MCP server.
- The `main` branch is hooked up to CI/CD

# Git-based development workflow

Our SDLC works as follows:
- We should always start work by branching to a branch like `<github-username>/<feature-description>`
- Make commits, as many as you need
- Generally, make sure you introduce test coverage on any change you make
- If performing an automated multi-step code change, do not open a PR unless prompted to do so by your user
- Open a Pull Request with a concise title for the change + detailed description of both the motivations behind the change and an overview of how it was implemented
