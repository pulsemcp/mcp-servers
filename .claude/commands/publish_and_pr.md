Goal: get a version bump for any relevant MCP servers in place, and get the PR going that we can merge after human review.

I want you to:

- [ ] Run the publication process for server updates ([PUBLISHING_SERVERS.md](../../docs/PUBLISHING_SERVERS.md))
- [ ] Open a PR (or update current one for your branch) in accordance with [pr.md](./pr.md)
