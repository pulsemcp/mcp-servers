There are merge conflicts in CI.

- [ ] Analyze the commit(s) that introduced the merge conflicts so you understand their intent
- [ ] Initiate a git rebase on `main`
- [ ] Go file-by-file as conflicts occur, assessing what the right merging is that still accomplishes the intent of both your PR and the conflicting commits
- [ ] Push changes that resolve the merge conflict
