# Pulse Fetch MCP Server

Haven't heard about MCP yet? The easiest way to keep up-to-date is to read our [weekly newsletter at PulseMCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/).

---

This is an MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)) Server that pulls specific resources from the open internet into context, designed for agent-building frameworks and MCP clients that lack built-in fetch capabilities.

Pulse Fetch is purpose-built for extracting clean, structured content from web pages while minimizing token usage and providing reliable access to protected content through advanced anti-bot bypassing capabilities.

This project is built and maintained by [PulseMCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/).

# Highlights

**Clean content extraction**: Strips out HTML noise using Mozilla's Readability algorithm to minimize token usage during MCP Tool calls.

**Intelligent caching**: Automatically caches scraped content as MCP Resources. Subsequent requests for the same URL return cached content instantly without network calls, dramatically improving performance.

**Anti-bot bypass**: Integrates with Firecrawl and BrightData APIs to reliably work around anti-scraping technology.

**Smart strategy selection**: Automatically learns and applies the best scraping method for specific URL patterns, improving performance over time.

**LLM-optimized**: Offers MCP Prompts and descriptive Tool design for better LLM interaction reliability.

**Flexible formats**: Supports multiple output formats including clean markdown, HTML, screenshots, and structured data extraction.

**Intelligent extraction**: Extract specific information using natural language queries powered by LLMs.

# Capabilities

This server is built and tested on macOS with Claude Desktop. It should work with other MCP clients as well.

| Tool Name | Description                                                                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scrape`  | Scrape a single webpage with advanced content extraction options and multiple output formats. |

# Usage Tips

- The `scrape` tool handles all web content extraction needs and automatically bypasses anti-bot protection when necessary
- **Result handling modes**: Control how scraped content is handled with the `resultHandling` parameter:
  - `saveAndReturn` (default): Saves content as MCP Resource AND returns it - best for reuse
  - `returnOnly`: Returns content without saving - use when you only need content once
  - `saveOnly`: Saves content as MCP Resource, returns only resource link - efficient for large content
- **Automatic caching**: Previously scraped URLs are cached by default. The tool returns cached content instantly on repeat requests
- Use `forceRescrape: true` to bypass the cache and get fresh content when you know the page has changed
- Use `maxChars` and `startIndex` parameters to handle large content that exceeds token limits
- Configure the timeout parameter (default 60s) for slow-loading sites
- Use the `extract` parameter with natural language queries to extract specific information from pages (requires LLM configuration)

# Examples

User: "This page is blocking me with CAPTCHA. Can you get the content from https://protected.example.com/data"
Assistant: I'll extract the content from that protected page for you.

[Uses scrape tool with automatic anti-bot bypass]

I successfully bypassed the protection and extracted the content from the page using BrightData's Web Unlocker capabilities.
```

## Intelligent Caching

```
User: "Get the content from https://example.com/article again"
Assistant: I'll retrieve that content for you.

[Uses scrape tool - automatically returns cached content]

I've retrieved the content from cache (originally scraped 2 hours ago). The article contains...

User: "Actually, I think that article was updated. Can you get the latest version?"
Assistant: I'll fetch a fresh copy of the article for you.

[Uses scrape tool with forceRescrape: true]

I've fetched the latest version of the article. I can see it was indeed updated with new information about...
```

## Result Handling Options

```
User: "I need to archive this entire article: https://example.com/long-article"
Assistant: I'll save that article as a resource for you.

[Uses scrape tool with resultHandling: 'saveOnly']

I've successfully archived the article. It's now saved as an MCP Resource that you can access later.

User: "Can you extract just the summary from https://example.com/report without saving it?"
Assistant: I'll extract just the summary without saving the full content.

# Why Choose Pulse Fetch?

If our [Design Principles](../README.md#design-principles) resonate with you, you should consider using our server.

The [official reference implementation of `fetch`](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/modelcontextprotocol-fetch) is the closest alternative. However:

- `fetch` has no mechanisms for bypassing anti-scraping technology, meaning attempts may randomly fail. We integrate with third-party services for reliable access.
- `fetch` is maintained by volunteers, so bugs or edge cases are less likely to be addressed quickly.
- `Pulse Fetch` caches responses as Resources, allowing easy inspection and re-use of Tool call outcomes.
- `Pulse Fetch` has more descriptive Tool design that more reliably triggers and completes desired tasks.

Most other alternatives fall short on one or more vectors:

- They are not purpose-built for pulling specific internet resources into context
- They may be multi-page crawlers, search engines, or tied to full REST APIs that confuse LLMs
- They do not make maximal use of MCP concepts like Resources and Prompts

# Setup

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended: use the version specified in package.json)
- Claude Desktop application (for local setup)
- Optional: Firecrawl API key for enhanced scraping capabilities
- Optional: BrightData bearer token for web unlocking features

### LLM Configuration for Extract Feature

The extract feature provides an alternative to MCP's native sampling capability for clients that don't support it. When configured, it enables intelligent information extraction from scraped content using LLMs. If neither LLM configuration nor MCP sampling is available, the `extract` parameter will not be shown in the tool.

| Environment Variable | Description                                              | Required | Default Value      | Example                       |

## Tools Reference

### scrape

Scrape a single webpage with advanced options for content extraction.

**Content Cleaning**

By default (`cleanScrape: true`), the tool automatically cleans scraped content:

- **HTML content**: Converts to semantic Markdown, removing navigation, ads, sidebars, and other boilerplate while preserving the main content structure. This typically reduces content size by 50-90%.
- **JSON/XML content**: Passes through unchanged (already structured)
- **Plain text**: Passes through unchanged

Disable cleaning (`cleanScrape: false`) only when:

- You need the exact raw HTML structure for parsing
- You're debugging scraping issues
- You're working with pre-structured content

**Parameters:**

- `url` (string, required): URL to scrape (e.g., "https://example.com" or just "example.com" - https:// is added automatically if no protocol is specified)
- `timeout` (number): Maximum time to wait for page load
- `maxChars` (number): Maximum characters to return (default: 100,000)
- `startIndex` (number): Character index to start output from (for pagination)
- `saveResult` (boolean): Save result as MCP Resource (default: true)
- `forceRescrape` (boolean): Force fresh scrape even if cached (default: false)
- `cleanScrape` (boolean): Clean HTML content by converting to semantic Markdown (default: true)
- `extract` (string): Natural language query for intelligent content extraction (requires LLM configuration)

## Roadmap & Future Ideas

### Planned Features

- [ ] MCP Sampling support for extraction - use the MCP client's native LLM capabilities when available
- [ ] Sampling (with external API fallback) to determine whether scrape was a success (and thus save it as a learning)
  - [ ] Right now, we determine whether a scrape succeeded based on HTTP status codes, which may not be reliable (e.g. 200 but anti-bot screen)
- [ ] Screenshot support
  - [ ] Allow format of `screenshot` and `screenshot-full-page` in `scrape` tool

### Future Enhancement Ideas

**Enhanced scraping parameters:**

- `includeHtmlTags`: HTML tags to include in output
- `excludeHtmlTags`: HTML tags to exclude from output
- `customUserAgent`: Custom User-Agent string
- `ignoreRobotsTxt`: Whether to ignore robots.txt restrictions
- `proxyUrl`: Optional proxy URL
- `headers`: Custom headers for requests
- `followLinks`: Follow related links on the page

**Interactive capabilities:**

- Execute custom actions like clicking or scrolling before scraping

**Image processing:**

- `imageStartIndex`: Starting position for image collection
- `raw`: Return raw content instead of processed markdown
- `imageMaxCount`: Maximum images to process per request
- `imageMaxHeight/Width`: Image dimension limits
- `imageQuality`: JPEG quality (1-100)
- `enableFetchImages`: Enable image fetching and processing

## Authentication Health Checks

Pulse Fetch validates API credentials at server startup to fail fast when authentication is misconfigured. This prevents silent failures during tool execution.

**Health Check Behavior:**

- Runs automatically when the server starts (unless disabled)
- Makes minimal test requests to verify API keys without consuming credits
- Exits with clear error messages if authentication fails
- Can be disabled by setting `SKIP_HEALTH_CHECKS=true`

**Example output with invalid credentials:**

```
Running authentication health checks...

Authentication health check failures:
  Firecrawl: Invalid API key - authentication failed
  BrightData: Invalid bearer token - authentication failed

To skip health checks, set SKIP_HEALTH_CHECKS=true
```

# Scraping Strategy Configuration

The pulse-fetch MCP server includes an intelligent strategy system that automatically selects the best scraping method for different websites.

## Optimization Modes

The `OPTIMIZE_FOR` environment variable controls the order and selection of scraping strategies:

- **`COST` (default)**: Optimizes for the lowest cost by trying native fetch first, then Firecrawl, then BrightData
  - Order: `native → firecrawl → brightdata`
  - Best for: Most use cases where cost is a concern
  - Behavior: Always tries the free native method first before paid services

- **`SPEED`**: Optimizes for faster results by skipping native fetch and starting with more powerful scrapers
  - Order: `firecrawl → brightdata` (skips native entirely)
  - Best for: Time-sensitive applications or sites known to block native fetch
  - Behavior: Goes straight to advanced scrapers that are more likely to succeed on complex sites

Example configuration:

```bash
export OPTIMIZE_FOR=SPEED  # For faster, more reliable scraping
export OPTIMIZE_FOR=COST   # For cost-effective scraping (default)
```

## How It Works

1. **Configured Strategy**: The server checks a local config file for URL-specific strategies
2. **Universal Fallback**: If no configured strategy exists or it fails, falls back to the universal approach (native → firecrawl → brightdata)
3. **Auto-Learning**: When a strategy succeeds, it's automatically saved to the config file with an intelligent URL pattern for future use

## Strategy Types

- **`native`**: Fast native fetch using Node.js fetch API (best for simple pages)
- **`firecrawl`**: Enhanced content extraction using Firecrawl API (good for complex layouts)
- **`brightdata`**: Anti-bot bypass using BrightData Web Unlocker (for protected content)

## Configuration File

The configuration is stored in a markdown table. By default, it's automatically created in your OS temp directory (e.g., `/tmp/pulse-fetch/scraping-strategies.md` on Unix systems). You can customize the location by setting the `STRATEGY_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

The table has three columns:

- **prefix**: Domain or URL prefix to match (e.g., `reddit.com` or `reddit.com/r/`)
- **default_strategy**: The strategy to use (`native`, `firecrawl`, or `brightdata`)
- **notes**: Optional description or reasoning

### Example Configuration

```markdown
| prefix        | default_strategy | notes                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| reddit.com/r/ | brightdata       | Reddit requires anti-bot bypass for subreddit pages |
| reddit.com    | firecrawl        | General Reddit pages work well with Firecrawl       |
| github.com    | native           | GitHub pages are simple and work with native fetch  |
```

### Prefix Matching Rules

- **Domain matching**: `github.com` matches `github.com`, `www.github.com`, and `subdomain.github.com`
- **Path matching**: `reddit.com/r/` matches `reddit.com/r/programming` but not `reddit.com/user/test`
- **Longest match wins**: If multiple prefixes match, the longest one is used

## Automatic Strategy Discovery

When scraping a new URL:

1. The system tries the universal fallback sequence (native → firecrawl → brightdata)
2. The first successful strategy is automatically saved to the config file with an intelligently extracted URL pattern
3. Future requests matching that pattern will use the discovered strategy

### URL Pattern Extraction

The system extracts URL patterns by removing the last path segment:

- **`yelp.com/biz/dolly-san-francisco`** → `yelp.com/biz/`
- **`reddit.com/r/programming/comments/123`** → `reddit.com/r/programming/comments/`
- **`example.com/blog/2024/article`** → `example.com/blog/2024/`
- **`stackoverflow.com/questions/123456`** → `stackoverflow.com/questions/`

For single-segment URLs or root URLs, only the hostname is saved. Query parameters and fragments are ignored during pattern extraction.

## Configuration Client Abstraction

The system uses an abstraction layer for config storage:

- **FilesystemClient**: Stores config in a local markdown file (default)
  - Uses `STRATEGY_CONFIG_PATH` if set
  - Otherwise uses OS temp directory (e.g., `/tmp/pulse-fetch/scraping-strategies.md`)
  - Automatically creates initial config with common patterns
- **Future clients**: Could support GCS, S3, database storage, etc.

You can swap the storage backend by providing a different `StrategyConfigFactory` when creating the MCP server.

# Resource Storage

Pulse Fetch stores scraped content as MCP Resources for caching and later retrieval. The storage system supports multiple tiers to preserve content at different processing stages.

## Storage Structure

Resources are saved in three separate stages:

1. **Raw**: Original content as scraped from the website
2. **Cleaned**: Cleaned content after applying content cleaners (HTML → Markdown, etc.)
3. **Extracted**: LLM-processed content containing only the requested information

### FileSystem Storage

When using filesystem storage (`MCP_RESOURCE_STORAGE=filesystem`), files are organized into subdirectories:

```
/tmp/pulse-fetch/resources/
├── raw/
│   └── example.com_article_20250701_123456.md
├── cleaned/
│   └── example.com_article_20250701_123456.md
└── extracted/
    └── example.com_article_20250701_123456.md
```

Each stage shares the same filename for easy correlation. The extracted files include the extraction prompt in their metadata for full traceability.

### Memory Storage

Memory storage uses a similar structure with URIs like:

- `memory://raw/example.com_article_20250701_123456`
- `memory://cleaned/example.com_article_20250701_123456`
- `memory://extracted/example.com_article_20250701_123456`

## Benefits

- **Debugging**: Easily inspect content at each processing stage
- **Efficiency**: Reuse cleaned content for different extraction queries
- **Traceability**: Track how content was transformed through each stage
- **Flexibility**: Choose which version to return based on your needs

# Extract Feature

The extract feature enables intelligent information extraction from scraped web content using LLMs. It serves as an alternative to MCP's native sampling capability for clients that don't support it.

## Overview

The extract functionality provides two ways to extract information:

1. **MCP Sampling** (not yet implemented): Uses the MCP client's native LLM capabilities
2. **Direct LLM API calls**: Configurable fallback using your own API keys

When neither option is available, the tool will work without extraction capabilities, returning raw scraped content only.

## How It Works

When you provide an `extract` parameter with a natural language query, the tool will:

1. First scrape the webpage content normally
2. Process the content through an LLM to extract the requested information
3. Return the extracted data instead of the raw HTML

## Architecture

### LLM Provider Support

The implementation supports three provider types:

1. **Anthropic (Native)**: Direct integration using Anthropic's SDK
   - Best for: Claude models with advanced reasoning capabilities
   - API: Uses Anthropic's native format

2. **OpenAI**: Direct integration with OpenAI's API
   - Best for: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models
   - API: Standard OpenAI format

3. **OpenAI-Compatible**: Support for any provider with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
   - Includes: Together.ai, Groq, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Fireworks AI, and more
   - API: OpenAI format with custom base URLs

### Configuration

Configure the extract feature using the environment variables described in the [LLM Configuration](#llm-configuration-for-extract-feature) section above.

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Extraction

```
User: "Get the author and publication date from this article: https://example.com/article"
Assistant: I'll extract that information from the article.

[Uses scrape tool with extract: "author name and publication date"]

The article was written by John Doe and published on March 15, 2024.
```

#### Complex Data Extraction

```
User: "Extract all product specifications from this page: https://shop.example.com/laptop"
Assistant: I'll extract the detailed specifications from that product page.

[Uses scrape tool with extract: "all technical specifications including processor, RAM, storage, display details, ports, and dimensions"]

Here are the laptop specifications:
- Processor: Intel Core i7-13700H
- RAM: 16GB DDR5
- Storage: 512GB NVMe SSD
...
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Client Abstraction Layer**: Common interface for all LLM providers
2. **Provider-Specific Clients**:
   - `AnthropicClient`: Native Anthropic API integration
   - `OpenAIClient`: OpenAI API integration
   - `OpenAICompatibleClient`: Flexible client for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
3. **Extraction Pipeline**:
   - Content preprocessing and chunking for large documents
   - Smart prompting based on extraction query
   - Response parsing and formatting
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - MCP sampling as primary method (when available)
   - Direct API calls as fallback
   - Error handling and retry logic

### Why This Approach?

- **Flexibility**: Users can choose their preferred LLM provider
- **Cost Optimization**: Support for various providers allows cost/performance trade-offs
- **Future-Proof**: OpenAI-compatible interface ensures new providers work automatically
- **MCP-First**: Designed to use MCP's sampling capabilities when available (not yet implemented)
