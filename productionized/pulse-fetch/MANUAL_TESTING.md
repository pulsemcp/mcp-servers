# Manual Testing Results

This file tracks the **most recent** manual test results for the Pulse Fetch MCP server.

**Note:** Each new test run should overwrite the previous results. We only maintain the latest test results here.

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Commit your changes BEFORE running tests**

   The test results will reference the current commit hash. If you have uncommitted changes, the commit hash will not represent what was actually tested:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

2. **Set up API credentials** - Ensure you have the necessary API credentials in your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example and add your real API keys
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-key-here
   BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
   Note: Pulse-fetch works without API keys for basic web fetching functionality.

### First-Time Setup (or after clean checkout)

If you're running manual tests for the first time or in a fresh worktree:

```bash
# This will verify environment, install dependencies, and build everything
npm run test:manual:setup
```

This setup script will:

- Check that .env file exists (optional for pulse-fetch)
- Install all dependencies (including test-mcp-client)
- Build the project and all test dependencies
- Verify everything is ready for manual testing

### Running Tests

Once setup is complete, run manual tests:

```bash
npm run test:manual              # Run all manual tests
```

Or run specific test suites:

```bash
npm run test:manual:pages        # Pages test suite
npm run test:manual:features     # Features test suite
```

## Latest Test Results

**Test Date:** 2025-07-24 11:18 PT

**Results by Test File:**

- ✅ authentication-healthcheck.test.ts: All 5 tests passed
  - Firecrawl authentication successful
  - BrightData authentication successful with API key
- ✅ scrape-tool.test.ts: All 3 tests passed
  - Basic scraping with automatic strategy selection working
  - Error handling working correctly (13.4s timeout test)
  - Content extraction with Anthropic LLM successful
- ✅ brightdata-scraping.test.ts: 1 test passed
  - BrightData client successfully scraped example.com (28.9s)
- ✅ firecrawl-scraping.test.ts: 1 test passed
  - Firecrawl client successfully scraped example.com (1.8s)
- ✅ native-scraping.test.ts: 2 tests passed
  - Native HTTP client working correctly
  - Successfully scraped example.com
- ✅ extract.test.ts: 3 tests passed (only Anthropic configured)
  - Anthropic extraction working with real API
  - Successfully extracted structured data from HTML
  - OpenAI/OpenAI-compatible tests skipped (not configured)
- ✅ test-filtering.test.ts: 1 test passed
  - **HTML filtering working excellently (78% content reduction achieved)**

### New Proxy Feature Tests

- ✅ proxy.test.ts: 6/6 tests passed
  - Proxy configuration correctly logged when env vars are set
  - No proxy configuration when env vars not set
  - All proxy documentation examples pass

### Pages Test Results

**Overall:** 25/25 tests passed (100%)

**Results by Configuration:**

- Native Only: 5/5 passed (100%)
- Firecrawl Only: 5/5 passed (100%) - PDF test correctly expects failure
- BrightData Only: 5/5 passed (100%)
- All Services (Cost Optimized): 5/5 passed (100%)
- All Services (Speed Optimized): 5/5 passed (100%)

**Test Design:**

- Firecrawl PDF test expects failure (Firecrawl doesn't support PDFs)
- Error pages (403/500) correctly expect failures
- All tests pass with their expected outcomes

**Summary:** All tests passing with expected results. Native strategy, BrightData, Firecrawl, and LLM extraction all working perfectly. Pages tests show proper fallback behavior. The new proxy support feature is correctly implemented and tested. The proxy configuration is properly applied when the MCP server starts with appropriate environment variables.
