# Manual Testing Results

This file tracks the **most recent** manual test results for the Pulse Fetch MCP server.

**Note:** Each new test run should overwrite the previous results. We only maintain the latest test results here.

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Commit your changes BEFORE running tests**

   The test results will reference the current commit hash. If you have uncommitted changes, the commit hash will not represent what was actually tested:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

2. **Set up API credentials** - Ensure you have the necessary API credentials in your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example and add your real API keys
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-key-here
   BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

### Running Tests

Run manual tests (automatically builds and tests against built code):

```bash
npm run test:manual
```

Or run specific test suites:

```bash
npm run test:manual:pages        # Pages test suite
npm run test:manual:features     # Features test suite
```

### Features Test Results

**Overall:** 14/16 tests passed (87.5%)

**Passed:**

- ✅ authentication-healthcheck.test.ts: All 5 tests passed
  - Firecrawl authentication check working
  - BrightData authentication check working
- ✅ brightdata-client.test.ts: BrightData client scraping working
- ✅ firecrawl-client.test.ts: Firecrawl client scraping working
- ✅ native-client.test.ts: Native HTTP client working
- ✅ server-initialization.test.ts: Server starts correctly
- ✅ file-storage.test.ts: File storage operations working
- ✅ scrape-tool.test.ts: Basic scraping with automatic strategy selection working

**Failed:**

- ❌ scrape-tool.test.ts: "should handle errors gracefully" - Test timed out after 30s
- ❌ scrape-tool.test.ts: "should support content extraction when LLM is configured" - Assertion error on result.isError

**Summary:** Core scraping functionality and API integrations are working correctly. The two failures in scrape-tool.test.ts need investigation but don't affect the main scraping strategies that were the focus of this fix.
