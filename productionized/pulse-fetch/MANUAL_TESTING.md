# Manual Testing Results

This file tracks the **most recent** manual test results for the Pulse Fetch MCP server.

**Note:** Each new test run should overwrite the previous results. We only maintain the latest test results here.

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **Commit your changes first** - The test results will reference the current commit hash, so ensure all changes are committed before running tests:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

2. **Set up API credentials** - Ensure you have the necessary API credentials in your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example and add your real API keys
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-key-here
   BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

### Running Tests

Run manual tests (automatically builds and tests against built code):

```bash
npm run test:manual
```

Or run specific test suites:

```bash
npm run test:manual:pages        # Pages test suite
npm run test:manual:features     # Features test suite
```

### Features Test Results

```
Test Files  1 failed | 6 passed (7)
     Tests  2 failed | 14 passed (16)

✓ tests/manual/features/authentication-healthcheck.test.ts (5 tests)
  ✓ Authentication Health Checks > Scraping Service Authentication
    ✓ should check scraping service authentication without consuming credits

✓ tests/manual/features/scrape-tool.test.ts (3 tests | 2 failed)
  ✓ should scrape a simple page with automatic strategy selection
  × should handle errors gracefully (timeout after 30s)
  × should support content extraction when LLM is configured

✓ tests/manual/clients/brightdata-client.test.ts
✓ tests/manual/clients/firecrawl-client.test.ts
✓ tests/manual/clients/native-client.test.ts
✓ tests/manual/server/server-initialization.test.ts

Exit code: 1 (2 test failures)

**Summary:** The pages test framework now correctly detects which scraping strategy was used and validates it against expectations. All pages tests are passing with the correct strategies being used. The features tests have 2 failures that need investigation, but the core API integrations (Firecrawl, BrightData) are working correctly.
