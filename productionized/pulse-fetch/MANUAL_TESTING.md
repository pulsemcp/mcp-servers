# Manual Testing Results

This file tracks the **most recent** manual test results for the Pulse Fetch MCP server.

**Note:** Each new test run should overwrite the previous results. We only maintain the latest test results here.

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Commit your changes BEFORE running tests**

   The test results will reference the current commit hash. If you have uncommitted changes, the commit hash will not represent what was actually tested:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

2. **Set up API credentials** - Ensure you have the necessary API credentials in your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example and add your real API keys
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-key-here
   BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
   Note: Pulse-fetch works without API keys for basic web fetching functionality.

### First-Time Setup (or after clean checkout)

If you're running manual tests for the first time or in a fresh worktree:

```bash
# This will verify environment, install dependencies, and build everything
npm run test:manual:setup
```

This setup script will:

- Check that .env file exists (optional for pulse-fetch)
- Install all dependencies (including test-mcp-client)
- Build the project and all test dependencies
- Verify everything is ready for manual testing

### Running Tests

Once setup is complete, run manual tests:

```bash
npm run test:manual              # Run all manual tests
```

Or run specific test suites:

```bash
npm run test:manual:pages        # Pages test suite
npm run test:manual:features     # Features test suite
```
