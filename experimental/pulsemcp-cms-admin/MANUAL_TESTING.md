- Network connectivity to https://admin.pulsemcp.com

## Test History

### Latest Test Run

**Date:** 2025-01-22  
**Commit:** 4dd9172  
**Status:** Fully Passing ✅  
**Notes:** All manual tests are now passing after implementing a workaround for the missing JSON support in Rails posts#show action.

**Test Results:**

- Tests Run: 9
- Passed: 9
- Failed: 0

**Working Features:**

- ✓ List posts with pagination (JSON response)
- ✓ Search posts (JSON response)
- ✓ Create draft posts (JSON response)
- ✓ Update posts (JSON response)
- ✓ Upload images (JSON response)
- ✓ Get individual posts (using list endpoint workaround)
- ✓ Error handling (404 responses)
- ✓ API key authentication
- ✓ Duplicate slug validation

**Implementation Notes:**

- For individual post retrieval, we use `GET /posts?search=<slug>` and filter results to find exact matches
- This workaround means the post body content is not available when retrieving individual posts
- Authors, MCP servers, and MCP clients endpoints are not available - using mock data

**Recommendation:** When Rails adds JSON support to posts#show, update the getPost function to use the proper endpoint.

## Running Manual Tests

```bash
# Ensure you have the API key set in .env
echo "PULSEMCP_ADMIN_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Run manual tests
npm run test:manual
```

## Test Coverage

Manual tests verify:

1. Real API connectivity
2. Newsletter post CRUD operations
3. Image upload functionality
4. Error handling with real API responses
5. Authentication with API keys
