# Manual Testing Results

This file tracks manual test results for the PulseMCP CMS Admin MCP server.

## Test Requirements

Manual tests require:

- A valid PulseMCP Admin API key in the `.env` file
- Network connectivity to https://admin.pulsemcp.com

## Test History

### Latest Test Run

**Date:** 2025-01-22  
**Commit:** 582e80f  
**Status:** Mostly Passing  
**Notes:** Manual tests were run with a valid PULSEMCP_ADMIN_API_KEY after the Rails application was updated to support JSON responses.

**Test Results:**

- Tests Run: 9
- Passed: 6
- Failed: 3 (get individual post - missing JSON support in Rails show action)

**Working Features:**

- ✓ List posts with pagination (JSON response)
- ✓ Search posts (JSON response)
- ✓ Create draft posts (JSON response)
- ✓ Update posts (JSON response)
- ✓ Upload images (JSON response)
- ✓ Error handling (404 responses)
- ✓ API key authentication

**Known Issues:**

- The Rails `GET /posts/:slug` endpoint (show action) doesn't have JSON support yet, only returns HTML
- Authors, MCP servers, and MCP clients endpoints are not available - using mock data

**Recommendation:** Add JSON support to the Rails posts#show action for full functionality.

## Running Manual Tests

```bash
# Ensure you have the API key set in .env
echo "PULSEMCP_ADMIN_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Run manual tests
npm run test:manual
```

## Test Coverage

Manual tests verify:

1. Real API connectivity
2. Newsletter post CRUD operations
3. Image upload functionality
4. Error handling with real API responses
5. Authentication with API keys
