## Test History

### Latest Test Run

**Date:** 2025-09-08 15:58 PDT  
**Commit:** 38c0ba3  
**Status:** Build verification only  
**Notes:** Build verification completed successfully. This is a metadata-only change (adding mcpName field) that does not affect functionality.

**Test Results:**

- Build: ✅ Successful
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- Integration tests: ✅ Built successfully

**Note:** Full manual API testing was not performed as no API key was available. Since this change only adds a metadata field and does not modify functionality, build verification is sufficient.

## Running Manual Tests

```bash
# Ensure you have the API key set in .env
echo "PULSEMCP_ADMIN_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Run manual tests
npm run test:manual
```

## Test Coverage

Manual tests verify:

1. Real API connectivity
2. Newsletter post CRUD operations
3. Image upload functionality
4. Error handling with real API responses
5. Authentication with API keys
