## Test History

### Latest Test Run

**Date:** 2025-01-22  
**Commit:** a42888b  
**Status:** Fully Passing ✅  
**Notes:** All manual tests are passing with real API calls for all resources (posts, authors, MCP servers, and MCP clients).

**Test Results:**

- Tests Run: 9
- Passed: 9
- Failed: 0

**Working Features:**

- ✓ List posts with pagination (JSON response via `/posts`)
- ✓ Search posts (JSON response)
- ✓ Create draft posts (JSON response)
- ✓ Update posts (JSON response)
- ✓ Upload images (JSON response)
- ✓ Get individual posts with full content (JSON response via `/supervisor/posts/:slug`)
- ✓ Error handling (404 responses)
- ✓ API key authentication
- ✓ Duplicate slug validation

**Implementation Notes:**

- Individual post retrieval uses `GET /supervisor/posts/:slug` which returns full post data including body content
- All resources (posts, authors, MCP servers, MCP clients) use real supervisor endpoints
- The supervisor endpoints expect slugs (not IDs) which aligns perfectly with our API design
- No mock data is used - all data comes from the live Rails API

## Running Manual Tests

```bash
# Ensure you have the API key set in .env
echo "PULSEMCP_ADMIN_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Run manual tests
npm run test:manual
```

## Test Coverage

Manual tests verify:

1. Real API connectivity
2. Newsletter post CRUD operations
3. Image upload functionality
4. Error handling with real API responses
5. Authentication with API keys
