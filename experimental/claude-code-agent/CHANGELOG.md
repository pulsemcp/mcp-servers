## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.5] - 2025-10-13

**üèóÔ∏è Major Architecture Refactoring: Server Installation System**

**BREAKING: Remove serverConfigs parameter from install_servers tool**

- **BREAKING**: Removed the `server_configs` parameter from the `install_servers` tool
- Users should now configure servers exclusively via environment variables instead
- This simplifies the tool interface and encourages proper configuration management
- No backwards compatibility provided as explicitly requested

**üöÄ New Features:**

- **Modular Server Installation Architecture**: Refactored 340+ lines of complex logic into focused, testable modules (`server-installer/` directory)
- **Intelligent Inference System**: Uses Claude Code for smart configuration decisions about environment variables and server selection
- **Enhanced Secrets Management**: Support for both JSON and KEY=VALUE (.env) formats with proper validation and backward compatibility
- **Complex Server Support**: Full support for local registries, custom runtime paths, and complex argument structures (packageArguments, runtimeArguments)
- **State Persistence**: Agent state now persists in MCP server working directory across restarts via PROJECT_WORKING_DIRECTORY environment variable
- **Improved Error Handling**: Hard fails on missing required secrets with clear error messages

**üîß Technical Improvements:**

- **Factory Pattern**: Dependency injection for better testability in server installer components
- **Separated Concerns**: Transport priorities (stdio < sse < http) vs runtime hints (dnx < docker < uvx < npx) logic
- **Registry Compliance**: Supports npm, pypi, oci, nuget, mcpb registries from official MCP registry schemas
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Comprehensive Zod schemas throughout server installer modules
- **Template Compatibility**: Secrets files now properly match .secrets.template format expectations

**üìã Configuration & Schema Enhancements:**

- **Dual Format Secrets Support**: FileSecretsProvider handles both JSON and KEY=VALUE formats with automatic quote stripping and comment handling
- **Schema Flexibility**: Support for both 'default' and 'value' fields in server configuration environment variables
- **Smart Validation**: Distinguishes between required secrets and optional ones with defaults
- **Template Variable Format**: Standardized ${SECRET_NAME} format in inference prompts
- **Registry Enum Mappings**: Correct python‚Üípypi mappings for proper inference

**üß™ Testing & Quality:**

- **67 Total Tests**: 33 new comprehensive unit tests + 34 existing functional/integration tests
- **Full Coverage**: All server installer modules have dedicated test suites with real-world scenarios
- **Manual Testing Verification**: Verified with real Twist and BigQuery server installations
- **Integration Testing**: Complete MCP protocol flow testing with TestMCPClient

**üêõ Bug Fixes:**

- **Environment Variable Handling**: Fixed logic to properly handle variables with default values (not treating them as required secrets)
- **Inference Prompt Issues**: Fixed enum value mappings and template variable formats for correct Claude responses
- **Schema Compatibility**: Added support for both legacy and standard server configuration formats
- **Build Process**: Restored missing setup-dev.js file needed for workspace symlink creation
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to server installation process for better troubleshooting
- **Argument Order**: Fixed argument order in claude-client-adapter.ts to ensure `-p` flag comes before prompt

**üìä Impact:**

- **37 files changed**: +2,812 additions, -518 deletions
- **Maintains Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing `install_servers` tool API (except removal of serverConfigs parameter)
- **Performance**: Reduced complexity while maintaining all functionality
- **Reliability**: Enhanced error handling and validation throughout

**üîÑ Migration Guide:**

- Remove any usage of `server_configs` parameter from `install_servers` tool calls
- Ensure environment variables are properly configured in servers.json
- Update secrets files to use KEY=VALUE format (JSON format still supported for backward compatibility)

## [0.0.4] - 2025-10-10

**CRITICAL FIX:**

- Restored missing `prepare-publish.js` file that was accidentally deleted during the directory architecture refactoring
- The prepare-publish.js script is essential for building and bundling the package correctly for npm publication
- Without this file, the `prepublishOnly` script fails and prevents proper package releases

**Technical Details:**

This restores the prepare-publish.js file that was accidentally removed in the directory architecture refactoring commit (1a5f484). The script handles TypeScript compilation, shared directory setup, and file copying for npm publishing. This fix ensures the claude-code-agent server can be properly built and published.

## [0.0.3] - 2025-10-10

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

- **BREAKING:** `init_agent` tool now requires `working_directory` parameter (absolute path)
- **BREAKING:** `init_agent` tool now accepts optional `agent_id` parameter for state directory naming
- **BREAKING:** Removed transcript resource (state resource now contains transcript path reference)

**Improvements:**

- Implemented directory separation: working directory (where agent operates) vs state directory (where state is stored)
- Fixed transcript path to point to Claude Code's native transcript files (`~/.claude/projects/{project-dir}/{session-id}.jsonl`)
- Enhanced path transformation logic to match Claude Code's naming convention for project directories
- Updated all tests to use new parameter structure and verify directory separation
- State storage now uses `CLAUDE_AGENT_BASE_DIR` exclusively with agent_id-based folder naming
- Improved security validation to allow both working and state directories

**Technical Details:**

This release addresses the fundamental directory structure issue where `/tmp/claude-agents` was being used for both agent operations and state storage. The new architecture cleanly separates:

- **Working Directory**: Where the Claude Code agent operates (user-specified via `working_directory` parameter)
- **State Directory**: Where state.json and other metadata are stored (`${CLAUDE_AGENT_BASE_DIR}/${agent_id}/`)
- **Transcript Path**: Points to Claude Code's native transcript files for seamless integration

Users upgrading from previous versions must update their `init_agent` calls to include the `working_directory` parameter.

## [0.0.2] - 2025-10-08

**CRITICAL FIX:**

- Added missing `prepare-publish.js` script that caused the 0.0.1 release to be published without any compiled JavaScript files
- Updated `prepublishOnly` script to properly build and bundle the package before publishing
- The npm package now correctly includes the `build/` directory with all executable code

**Technical Details:**

This fix resolves the issue where `npx claude-code-agent-mcp-server` would fail with "command not found" because the published package only contained README.md and package.json. The package now includes all necessary files for execution.

## [0.0.1] - 2025-10-04

Initial release of the Claude Code Agent MCP Server - an agentic MCP configuration solution that solves the "tool overload" problem by enabling dynamic Claude Code subagent spawning with only relevant MCP servers.

**Core Features:**

- 7 tools for managing Claude Code subagents (`init_agent`, `find_servers`, `install_servers`, `chat`, `inspect_transcript`, `stop_agent`, `get_server_capabilities`)
- 2 resources for agent state monitoring (Subagent State and Transcript)
- Automatic server discovery based on task requirements
- Claude CLI integration with session continuation support
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure (functional, integration, and manual tests)
- Environment variable validation and error handling
- Mock Claude Code client for development and testing
