# Manual Testing Results

This file tracks the **most recent** manual test results for the Twist MCP server.

**Note:** Each new test run should overwrite the previous results. We only maintain the latest test results here.

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Commit your changes BEFORE running tests**

   The test results will reference the current commit hash. If you have uncommitted changes, the commit hash will not represent what was actually tested:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

2. **Set up API credentials** - Ensure you have the necessary API credentials in your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example if available and add your real API keys
   TWIST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
   TWIST_WORKSPACE_ID=your-workspace-id
   ```

### Running Tests

Run manual tests (automatically builds and tests against built code):

```bash
npm run test:manual
```
