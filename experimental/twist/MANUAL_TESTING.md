# Manual Testing Results

This file tracks the **most recent** manual test results for the Twist MCP server.

**Note:** Each new test run should overwrite the previous results. We only maintain the latest test results here.

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Commit your changes BEFORE running tests**

   The test results will reference the current commit hash. If you have uncommitted changes, the commit hash will not represent what was actually tested:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

2. **Set up API credentials** - Ensure you have the necessary API credentials in your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example if available and add your real API keys
   TWIST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
   TWIST_WORKSPACE_ID=your-workspace-id
   ```

### Running Tests

Run manual tests (automatically builds project and tests against built code):

```bash
npm run test:manual
```

The tests will:

1. Build the project first (compiles TypeScript to JavaScript)
2. Run tests against the built JavaScript code (not source TypeScript)
3. This ensures we're testing the actual code that would be published
