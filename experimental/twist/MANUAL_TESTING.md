# Manual Testing Results

This file tracks the **most recent** manual test results for the Twist MCP server.

**Note:** Each new test run should overwrite the previous results. We only maintain the latest test results here.

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Commit your changes BEFORE running tests**

   The test results will reference the current commit hash. If you have uncommitted changes, the commit hash will not represent what was actually tested:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

2. **Set up API credentials** - Ensure you have the necessary API credentials in your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example if available and add your real API keys
   TWIST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
   TWIST_WORKSPACE_ID=your-workspace-id
   ```

### First-Time Setup (or after clean checkout)

If you're running manual tests for the first time or in a fresh worktree:

```bash
# This will verify environment, install dependencies, and build everything
npm run test:manual:setup
```

This setup script will:

- Check that .env file exists and has a real API key
- Install all dependencies (including test-mcp-client)
- Build the project and all test dependencies
- Verify everything is ready for manual testing

### Running Tests

Once setup is complete, run manual tests:

```bash
npm run test:manual
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
npm run test:manual -- tests/manual/your-test.manual.test.ts
```

The tests will:

1. Build the project first (compiles TypeScript to JavaScript)
2. Run tests against the built JavaScript code (not source TypeScript)
3. This ensures we're testing the actual code that would be published
