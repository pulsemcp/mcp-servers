# CI Setup for Twist MCP Server

## CI Integration Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The Twist MCP Server is fully integrated into the repository's CI/CD pipeline:

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- **File**: `.github/workflows/twist-ci.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to main or PR changes in `experimental/twist/`
- **Jobs**:
  - Functional Tests (13 tests)
  - Integration Tests (12 tests)

### Automatic CI Inclusion

The workflow is automatically included in CI checks because:

- Workflow name includes "MCP Server"
- The main CI workflow (`ci-build-test-checks.yml`) waits for all MCP Server checks
- Linting is handled by the root `lint.yml` workflow

### Local Verification Status

- ✅ All functional tests pass
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ Code is properly linted and formatted
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ All dependencies properly declared

## Publication Process (Future)

When ready to publish the Twist MCP Server to npm:

### 1. Prepare for Publishing

- Add necessary npm scripts to `local/package.json`:
  - `prepublishOnly`: Script to prepare README for npm
  - `stage-publish`: Helper for version bumping
- Add `publishConfig` and `files` fields to control what gets published
- Create a script to merge main README with local configuration details

### 2. Version and Publish

- Navigate to `experimental/twist/local/`
- Update version: `npm version patch/minor/major`
- Build the project: `npm run build`
- Publish to npm: `npm publish`
- The server will be published as `mcp-server-twist`

### 3. Post-Publication

- Create a git tag for the release
- Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- Announce in appropriate channels

Note: Experimental servers are published directly from their location without moving to a productionized folder.
