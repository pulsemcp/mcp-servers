# Manual Testing Results

This file tracks the **most recent** manual test results for the agent-orchestrator MCP server.

**Note:** Each new test run should overwrite the previous results. We only maintain the latest test results here.

## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. **Commit your changes BEFORE running tests**

   The test results will reference the current commit hash. If you have uncommitted changes, the commit hash will not represent what was actually tested:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

2. **Set up API credentials** - Ensure you have the necessary API credentials in your `.env` file:

   ```bash
   # Copy from .env.example and add your real API keys
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your credentials
   ```

3. **Start Agent Orchestrator** - The agent-orchestrator API must be running locally:
   ```bash
   # In the agent-orchestrator directory
   bin/rails server
   ```

### First-Time Setup (or after clean checkout)

If you're running manual tests for the first time or in a fresh worktree:

```bash
# This will verify environment, install dependencies, and build everything
npm run test:manual:setup
```

This setup script will:

- Check environment setup (.env file)
- Install all dependencies (including test-mcp-client)
- Build the project and all test dependencies
- Verify everything is ready for manual testing

### Running Tests

Once setup is complete, run manual tests:

```bash
npm run test:manual
```

The tests will:

1. Build the project first (compiles TypeScript to JavaScript)
2. Run tests against the built JavaScript code (not source TypeScript)
3. This ensures we're testing the actual code that would be published

## Latest Test Results

**Test Date:** 2025-12-12
**Branch:** agent-orchestrator/initial-implementation
**Commit:** 3e576eb
**Tested By:** Claude Code (automated)
**Environment:** Simplified 4-tool implementation

### Summary

**Overall:** N/A (manual tests pending - requires agent-orchestrator API_KEYS configuration)

This release simplifies the tool surface from 15 tools to 4 tools:

- `search_sessions` - Search/list sessions with optional ID lookup
- `get_session` - Get detailed session info with optional logs/transcripts
- `start_session` - Create and start a new session
- `action_session` - Perform actions (follow_up, pause, restart, archive, unarchive)

**Functional tests:** All 16 tests pass (100%)

Manual testing against the agent-orchestrator API requires the API_KEYS environment variable to be set on the Rails server. The MCP server's .env file credentials must match a key in the API_KEYS list.

## CI Verification

This file is checked by CI during version bumps. The CI workflow verifies:

1. Manual tests were run on a commit in the PR's history
2. The commit hash in this file matches a commit in the PR
3. Tests show passing results

**Important:** Always update this file after running manual tests and before creating a version bump.
